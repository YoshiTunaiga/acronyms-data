| Tech Debt              |                                                                                                                  In software development, or any other IT field technical debt is the implied cost of future reworking required when choosing an easy but limited solution instead of a better approach that could take more time.                                                                                                                   |          |

It allows a team and individuals to highlight both the successes and failures of a project, identify areas that need improvement, and reflect on the project as a whole.                                                                             |          |

| Canonical Build        |                                                                            A canonical model is a design pattern used to communicate between different data formats. Essentially, create a data model that is a superset of all the others ("canonical"), and create a "translator" module or layer to/from which all existing modules exchange data with other modules.                                                                             |          |
| Proof of Concept (POC) |                          A proof of concept (POC) is the process of proving that an idea is feasible. It's a screening phase to decide whether the idea can and should be brought to life. A POC may very well reveal that a great-on-paper proposal doesn't have legs to stand on, in which case it should be revised or trashed. It's similar to a painted door test, which can shed light on the popularity of an idea.                           |          |
| Regression             |                                                                                                                                                           Regression testing is a type of software testing conducted after a code update to ensure that the update introduced no new bugs.                                                                                                                                                           |          |

The system still meets the needs it was originally designed for but doesn't allow for growth.                                                                                                                                          |
| Design System          |                                                                                           A design system is a collection of reusable components and clear standards that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. Design systems aid in digital product design and development of products such as mobile applications or websites.                                                                                           |          |

| Accessibility          |                                                                                                                      Web accessibility (also referred to as a11y) is the design and creation of websites that can be used by everyone. Accessibility support is necessary to allow assistive technology to interpret web pages.                                                                                                                      |
| React Library          |                                                                                                                                                                                      React is a JavaScript library that's used for building reactive websites.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Version Control        | A system that manages and tracks changes to a project's codebase, enabling collaboration among multiple contributors, preserving a chronological history of alterations, and facilitating the efficient coordination of software development efforts. Version control is like a time machine for your project, allowing you to keep track of changes, work collaboratively with others, and easily roll back to earlier states if needed. on Scripts |
| Batch Processing       |                                                                                        Batch processing is the method computers use to periodically complete high-volume, repetitive data jobs. Certain data processing tasks, such as Backups, filtering, and sorting can be compute-intensive and inefficient when running on individual data transactions.                                                                                        |
